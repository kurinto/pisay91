<!-- h1>A Study on the Side Effects of "Revertigo" Phenomenon</h1 -->
<br><br> 
<h2>i. Abstract</h2>
Late one evening I was watching a rerun episode of <b class="big">How I Met Your Mother</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">1</a>)</sup> and I came across the term <b class="big">"Revertigo"</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">2</a>)</sup>, a term which was used to describe a person's change in behavior whenever he or she gets in touch with a person from their past. It describes an odd and unexplainable tendency to become the person you used to be when you were with that person, such as talking like you used to (e.g. shouting across the hall, now shouting across MRT trains), eating like you used to (mabilis na kaya kumain si Joe?) and generally behaving like a kid (e.g. pretending to enjoy a cartoon so you won't need to wash the dishes). 
<br><br>
Now this website has nothing to do with any of that. I just needed a catchy blurb so people will actually read on. Believe me, the title does not even make sense. 
<br><br>

<h2>ii. Methodology</h2>
This is how you do it. 
<br><br>
First you create a <b class="big">facebook</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">3</a>)</sup> account. Then you look for all the people you know. Then you will realize that you can group all these people into several "circles of influence" kind of thing. You will realize that facebook can do that for you easily. So you group your mafia, err... your friends into people who actually play the game and you get excited for several months and suddenly people stop sending you energy packs. They lose interest in the game and then you have no one to play mafia wars with.
<br><br>
Then you download the latest movies around. woohoo for piratebay. Then you get to the see "the social network". Then you search the internet for more info on the movie. Then you stumble on an old link <b class="big">facebuko</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">4</a>)</sup> and thought, hey that site is funny, I wonder how he made that? Then you download <b class="big">wordpress</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">5</a>)</sup> and the <b class="big">smells-like-facebook</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">6</a>)</sup> theme (which is no longer up btw but the author graciously left links to get to his latest dev version) to find out. Then you look at the code and think to yourself, hey I think I can replicate this on a <b class="big">smarty</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">7</a>)</sup>/<b class="big">xampp</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">8</a>)</sup> setup.
<br><br>
Then you remember your "grouped" facebook friends and look for anything that can inspire you. Then you ride an FX from work and you overhear two kolehiyala's exchanging contact info, girl1: "May pisbuk ka?", girl2: "oo, meron" *me giggles (buti na lang maganda ka day). Then an epiphany on the name <b class="big">"Pisbuk"</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">9</a>)</sup> (hover your mouse on the logo above to see what i'm talking about). Perfect!, so HS batchmates it is. Then you tell your wife "mi, I'm going to work on something that won't make us any money but will make you famous, k lang?". When she replies "Bahala ka sa buhay mo!", Then you start coding and ignore her for 2 weeks.
<br><br>
Along the way you will encounter <b class="big">jQuery</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">10</a>)</sup>, a wonderful set of javascript libraries that make ajax calls a breeze, not to mention the <b class="big">plugins</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">11</a>)</sup><sup>(<a href="#ref">12</a>)</sup><sup>(<a href="#ref">13</a>)</sup><sup>(<a href="#ref">14</a>)</sup> are to die for. Add a bit of <b class="big">random fortune</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">15</a>)</sup> so the site seem to have lots of words. Then top it off with <b class="big">smart image resizer</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">16</a>)</sup> and your pictures practically resize themselves.
<br><br>
Then you borrow a bunch of pictures from <b class="big">these kind people</b><sup>(<a href="#ref">17</a>)</sup>, arrange some pixels here and there... and you're done. Just in time for <a href="{$CONFIG_DATA_URL}prince-william-kate-wedding-kiss2.jpg" rel="Litratuwaan[royal]">Kate and William's royal wedding</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90qbf__gPzY" rel="Litratuwaan[pacman]" title="Pacman vs Shame Mostly">Pacquiao's fight with <s>Shane Mosley</s> Shame Mostly</a>. Oh, and our <a href="{$CONFIG_DATA_URL}Pisay_homecoming_poster_18_x_24.jpg" rel="Litratuwaan[hc2011]">20th anniversary as graduates of this wonderful school</a>.
<br><br>
Don't forget to <a href="#top" id="wini">thank your wife</a> for the endless coffee and hugs of encouragement.
<br><br>
<h2>iii. Conclusion</h2>
<b class="big">Pisbuk is not and will not be a social networking site</b>. This is still just a catalog type website. Nothing more.
<br>
Pisbuk depends on javascript. <b class="big">Get the latest browser, no excuses</b>.
